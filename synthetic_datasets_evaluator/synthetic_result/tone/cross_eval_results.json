Despite having paid for support, I have found response times to be extremely slow, and in some cases, my inquiries have been ignored entirely. This has made managing my workload much more challenging.\n\nI would appreciate it if someone could address these issues as soon as possible. If this cannot be resolved promptly, I would like to request a refund.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]",
