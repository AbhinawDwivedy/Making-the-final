I\u2019ve been trying so hard to keep up, but lately, it just feels like I\u2019m constantly overwhelmed by the workload. Every time I start to make progress, something else comes up, and it\u2019s difficult not to feel discouraged. I genuinely believed I could manage everything, but right now, it feels like things just aren\u2019t going my way.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how others are managing; I stayed up all night working on the project, but I still lost track of time. Now it feels like all that effort was for nothing, which is incredibly frustrating. The stress and pressure are starting to feel unmanageable, and it\u2019s hard not to feel like I\u2019m falling behind.\n\nI really wish I could get some support or, at the very least, some understanding. Right now, it\u2019s just too much for me to handle on my own, and I\u2019m not sure what steps to take next. I\u2019d appreciate any guidance or help you could offer. Thank you for understanding."}
