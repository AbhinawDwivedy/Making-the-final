Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I am truly sorry to have to send this email, but I missed the deadline for the assignment. I was up all night working on it, but unfortunately, I lost track of time and my mind just seemed to shut down from exhaustion. I’ve been trying so hard to manage everything, but at times it just feels overwhelming. I realize I should have planned things more carefully, and I feel terrible for letting it slip.

I am embarrassed to ask, but I was hoping you might consider granting me an extension. I promise I will complete the assignment as soon as possible. I really appreciate your understanding and any help you can offer during this difficult time.

Thank you so much for considering my request.

Best regards,

So, like, it’s been forever since we were supposed to get that payment, right? 😩 I mean, I get it, things happen, but come on! 😤 It’s like we’re just sitting here twiddling our thumbs while the bills keep piling up. 📅💸 I don’t even know how much longer we can keep waiting for this. It’s driving me totally bananas! 🙈💥 Every day feels like a countdown to disaster.  

Seriously, can someone please give me an update or something? I’m practically losing my mind here! 😵‍💫 This whole situation is just giving me major anxiety, and I’m really tired of feeling this way. 🥵 Let’s get it together, people!  

Thanks… I guess? 🙄","Subject: Request for Update on Payment Status

Hi team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the payment we’ve been expecting—it’s been quite a while, and I know we’re all feeling the impact of the delay. I understand that unexpected issues can come up, and I don’t mean to add any extra pressure. Still, the wait has been challenging, especially as our bills continue to add up.

If there’s any update you can share, I would really appreciate it. Not knowing what to expect has been stressful, and I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling anxious about the situation. Your support and communication would mean a lot to us right now.

Thank you for understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

10,Sympathetic,gpt-4.1,gpt-4o-mini,True,"OMG!!! 😱 So, like, I totally messed up and missed the deadline for that super important assignment 😭😭. I thought I had everything under control, but then life just threw a million things at me and I kinda panicked and lost track of time 🕒😬. 

I know I should have been more organized, but honestly, I was just freaking out about exams and everything else 🤯💔. I’m really hoping there’s a way I can turn it in late? Pretty please? 🙏 I promise I’ll make it worth it, like maybe I can do some extra work or something?? 🤔✌️

I totally understand if you’re like, NOPE, but I’m just really stressed right now and I don’t want to bomb this class 💔💔. Let me know what you think, like ASAP, because I’m about to lose it over here 😩😩!!","Subject: Request for Extension on Assignment

Hi [Instructor’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing because I unfortunately missed the deadline for the recent assignment. I genuinely thought I had everything managed, but a combination of unexpected challenges and the stress of exams overwhelmed me, and I lost track of time.

I realize I should have been more organized, and I take responsibility for not reaching out sooner. I’m really worried about how this will impact my grade, and I was hoping there might be an opportunity to submit the assignment late. If possible, I’d be more than willing to do extra work to make up for it.

I completely understand if late submissions aren’t allowed, but I wanted to explain my situation. I’m just feeling very stressed and worried about not doing well in the class. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or any options available.

Thank you so much for your understanding.
