Lately, it\u2019s become increasingly challenging to keep track of our conversations and updates, as everyone seems to be using different tools and platforms for communication. This can sometimes make it difficult to stay organized and ensure that important information doesn\u2019t get missed.\n\nWould it be possible for us to discuss consolidating our communication channels? Streamlining the tools we use could help us all stay on the same page and make our collaboration more efficient.\n\nThank you for considering this suggestion.
